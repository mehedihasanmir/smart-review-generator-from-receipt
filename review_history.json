      "review_text": "This Champion hoodie? Yeah, it's very comfortable. The soft cotton blend really makes a difference, especially when it's cold out. The hood? It's adjustable, fits different head sizes no problem. Only issue is with the front pocket. Personally, I don't like it much. In my case, it seemed to lose its shape after a few days. But still, overall, it's a solid hoodie. Definitely worth keeping this stocked.",
